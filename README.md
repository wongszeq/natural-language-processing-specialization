NLP specialization on NLP task including:

Course-1:
1) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and naive Bayes
2) Use vector space model to discover relationships between words
3) Use PCA to reduce dimensionality of vector space and visulize relationships
4) Use pre-computed word embeddings to perform langugage translation 
5) Use locality sensitive hashing(LSH) to relate words via approximate k-NN search

Course-2:
1) Create auto-correct algorithm using mimimum edit distance and dynamic programming
2) Apply Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging 
3) Improve auto-correct algorithm using N-gram language model
4) Create Word2Vec model using neural networks to compute word embeddings using contunious bag-of-word model

Course-3:
1) Sentiment analysis of tweets with GloVe word embeddings
2) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) language model
3) Perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers
4) Use Siamese LSTM model to compare questions in a corpus to identify differnet words with same meaning

Course-4:
1) Use encoder-decoder attention model to perform sentences translation
2) Build a Transformer model to summarize text
3) Use T5 and BERT models to perform Q&A
4) Build a chatbot using Reformer model
